              Country View and Economic Conditions :
            </h3>
            <p style="color: #022135;line-height:26px; ">North America’s regional outlook is maintained as ‘deteriorating’. In the U.S., Q1 GDP growth at
              1.1% (annualized) came in lower than expected, underlining a slowdown over the previous quarter.
              This was followed by the news of JP Morgan’s takeover of First Republic Bank, resurfacing the risk
              of a systemic banking crisis and a warning from Treasury Secretary Yellen that the ‘X’ date – by
              which date the U.S. Congress must approve a suspension or increase in debt issuance ceiling –
              may arrive sooner than previously anticipated. While these signals do not bode for well the
              economy, the Fed persisted with a 25-bps rate hike to tame inflation. Bank failures will further
              squeeze credit flow in the economy, and the risk to financial market stability has given the Fed a
              reason to pause rate increments sooner than what inflation dynamics would probably warrant (likely
              at the next meeting). As credit conditions tighten further, downside risks to the economy will
              become more prominent, although an outright recession is still not our base case scenario.</p>

<h3 style="color:#022135">Recent market movers</h3>
<p style="color: #022135;line-height:26px; ">Asset markets witnessed high volatility in May as investors navigated uncertainties around US
  debt ceiling, future course of monetary policy in the US and China’s economic recovery. In this
  edition, we have covered what were the major market movers in May and the way forward.</p>
        </div>
       
<p style="color: #022135;line-height:26px; "><b style="color:#022135">• US data</b>: Recent data shows that inflation is moderating in the US, however, not at the pace
    required to achieve 2% inflation target set by the Federal Reserve. Going by inflation measure
    which the US central bank closely tracks, inflation stood at 4.4% in April vs. 4.2% earlier. In the
    labour market, the unemployment stood at 3.4% in Apr-23, closer to its historical low. This
    combination of high inflation and tight labour market conditions has raised expectations of more
    rate hikes and pushed back rate cut expectations in the US. We expect one more rate hike by the
    Fed in June or July, with increasing chances of a hawkish pause in June.</p>
    <p style="color: #022135;line-height:26px; "><b style="color:#022135">• Dollar view</b>:The dollar index continues to remain bid both in risk-on and off scenarios and the
      rally seems to be beyond a pure “safe haven” play. In the near term, the dollar index is expected
      to remain supported, which could weigh on emerging market currencies as well as on the EUR,
      the JPY and the GBP. Over the medium term, a sustained moderation in the dollar is likely to
      take place only after the Fed commits to end its rate hike cycle. However, the moderation could
      be limited as elevated inflation and tight labour market, could decrease rate cut expectations.</p>
      <p style="color: #022135;line-height:26px; "><b style="color:#022135">• EUR Outlook</b>:The EUR/USD pair fell by 2.7% in May-23. Apart from dollar strength, Eurozone
        specific factors have weighed on the pair. We expect the pair to remain under pressure in the
        near-term despite further rate hikes by the ECB. Near term range-1.06-1.08. Some reversal is
        likely towards the second half of the year towards 1.08-1.11 range as the dollar rally subsides
        and rate cuts expectations resurface.</p>
        <p style="color: #022135;line-height:26px; "><b style="color:#022135">• INR Outlook</b>:After a strong rebound in Q1, China’s recovery has been weak, with which the
          USD/CNY pair fell by ~3% in May-23. With the increased correlation between the CNY and the
          INR, the INR has come under some pressure, against the dollar. However, healthy portfolio flows
          and two-way intervention by the RBI has kept the pair range-bound. We expect the pair to trade
          in the range of 82.50-83.0, in the run up to Fed’s June meeting. Over the medium term, we see
          the pair trading in the range of 80.50-81.50.</p>

                    • The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued an advisory to banks and other RBI-regulated
entities, emphasizing the need to take steps to ensure a complete transition away from the
London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) from July 01, 2023. The key messages in the
advisory include:
                  </p>
                  <p  style="color: #022135;line-height:26px; ">
                    • Banks / Financial Institutions (FIs) are advised to ensure that no new transaction undertaken
                    by them or their customers rely on or are priced using the US$ LIBOR or the Mumbai
                    Interbank Forward Outright Rate (MIFOR).
                  </p>
                  <p  style="color: #022135;line-height:26px; ">
                    • The Financial Benchmarks India Pvt. Ltd. (FBIL) will cease to publish MIFOR after June 30,
2023.
                  </p>
                  <p  style="color: #022135;line-height:26px; ">
                    • Banks/FIs are advised to take all necessary steps to ensure insertion of fallbacks at the
                    earliest in all remaining legacy financial contracts that reference US$ LIBOR (including
                    transactions that reference MIFOR).
                  </p>
                  <p  style="color: #022135;line-height:26px; ">
                    • Banks/FIs are expected to have developed the systems and processes to manage the
                    complete transition away from LIBOR.
                  </p>
                  <p  style="color: #022135;line-height:26px; ">
                    The Reserve Bank will continue to monitor the efforts of banks/FIs for ensuring a smooth
                    transition from LIBOR.
                  </p>

                    Remittances to International Financial Services Centres (IFSCs) under the
                    Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS)
                  </p>
                <p  style="color: #022135;line-height:26px; ">•  RBI has directed that “Resident Individuals may also open a Foreign Currency Account (FCA)
                  in IFSCs, for making the above permissible investments under LRS.”</p>
                  <p style="color: #022135;line-height:26px; ">
                    Thus, the condition of repatriating any funds lying idle in the account for a period up to 15 days
from the date of its receipt is withdrawn with immediate effect, which shall now be governed by
the provisions of the scheme as contained in the aforesaid Master Direction on LRS.

    <p style="line-height:28px;"> In the interconnected fabric of today's world, the global economy
      thrives on the threads of international trade. This exchange of
      goods, services, and capital across international borders is not
      only essential to nations' growth and development but also
      pivotal in shaping their economic landscapes. In this context,
      the need for a common platform for industry leaders,
      policymakers, business owners, analysts, trade professionals,
      and bankers to share insights and perspectives on global trade
      becomes evident.</p>

<p style="line-height:28px;">The Global Trade and Forex Talks (GTFT) is an initiative that offers precisely this platform. GTFT
  serves as a dynamic forum fostering collaboration and the exchange of knowledge among the
  industry's most distinguished figures.</p>
  <p style="line-height:28px;">It provides a venue for a multitude of discussions, ranging from foreign trade policy (FTP) to
    public procurement practices, and overcoming legal hurdles in international markets, amongst
    others. Through this wide array of topics, GTFT offers an in-depth and transparent view of the
    global trade landscape.</p>
    <p style="line-height:28px;">The most recent GTFT session in May 2023, hosted under the aegis of the Directorate General
      of Foreign Trade (DGFT), Ministry of Commerce and Industry, dove into FTP 2023 and various
      government policies and initiatives aimed at addressing the needs of exporters. This forum
      proved invaluable as industry veterans, policy-makers, and trade experts gathered to deliberate
      and analyze the ever-changing dynamics of global trade and the strategies necessary to navigate
      this complex terrain successfully.</p>
      <p style="line-height:28px;">In essence, GTFT acts as a catalyst for change, breaking barriers, and convening industry
        luminaries, policymakers, analysts, and trade professionals to shape the future of global trade.
        By creating an atmosphere of collaboration and transparency, GTFT propels us towards a world
        where trade is not just sustainable but a driving force of economic progress.</p>
        <p style="line-height:28px;">
          Moving forward, GTFT intends to carry on its mission of promoting collaboration and knowledge
sharing among global trade and forex experts. The upcoming session promises to deliver even
more enlightening discussions and insights into the world of international commerce.
